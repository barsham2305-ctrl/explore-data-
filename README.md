Today, I walked through a hands-on demo in Jupyter Notebook, working with Python to load and explore a dataset.
 From importing essential libraries to reading CSV files and previewing data, this workflow is key to any data-driven project.
 It’s always exciting to see how a few lines of code can turn raw data into meaningful insights.
 Building strong foundations in data analysis is a continuous journey — and every step adds value.
 Looking forward to expanding these skills even further.
